Why are the LVM2 and crypto libraries so ugly?
==============================================

Even if some bindings for LVM2 and cryptosetup are available, we do not
want to change too much from upstream (= debian).
So when python bindings for these applications will be available in
Debian, we will update our libraries to use them.

For now you'll have to deal with the ugly subprocesses ;)
